      "title": "Wall Street analysts explain how AMD’s own stock will pay for OpenAI’s billions in chip purchases",
      "content": "After AMD and OpenAI announced an expanded partnership on Monday, the chatter immediately turned to the unusual way OpenAI would pay for its AMD purchases. It will use AMD’s own stock to do so. To recap: OpenAI has agreed to help AMD refine its line of Nvidia competitor chips, the Instinct GPUs, as well as to purchase and deploy 6 gigawatts of compute capacity from AMD over multiple years. AMD said this deal is worth billions in revenue. But OpenAI isn’t paying for this out of its own revenues. Instead AMD has granted OpenAI a boatload of stock warrants — up to 160 million AMD shares — which will vest in tranches as certain milestones are achieved. Those milestones include specific increases in the stock price, with the last tranche dependent on AMD shares soaring to $600 million apiece, AMD disclosed. They were trading at about $165 before the news hit and soared to $214 by market close Monday after the announcement. If the stock price hits its marks, and OpenAI achieves all its required contributions, and OpenAI holds all of AMD’s shares, not selling any along the way, OpenAI may make enough on AMD stock to pay for a lot of GPUs. The stock could be worth about a $100 billion. “We would note that the final 6th tranche requires ~$1T market cap to vest – ergo, if OAI were to hold stock until the end of the deal, its stake would be worth ~$100B,” writes UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri in a research note on Tuesday. But Arcuri believes that a more likely scenario is that OpenAI will sell its AMD stock along the way to pay its AMD bill. So, essentially, this is a scheme for AMD to finance this customer’s purchases. Still, Arcuri argues, the validation that AMD’s AI GPUs can handle OpenAI workloads, and ergo any other AI workloads, is valuable enough for AMD to make this financing gambit. “AMD highlighted ongoing customer dialogs beyond OpenAI and expects this agreement to ultimately accelerate AMD adoption momentum,” he writes. In particular, OpenAI’s stamp of approval gives",

      "content": "Google is expanding access to Opal, its AI vibe-coding app, to 15 more countries. The app, which lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, is now available in Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panamá, Honduras, Argentina, and Pakistan. “When we opened up Opal to users in the U.S. we anticipated they might build simple, fun tools,” said Megan Li, a Senior Product Manager at Google Labs, in a blog post. “We didn’t expect the surge of sophisticated, practical and highly creative Opal apps we got instead. The ingenuity of these early adopters made one thing clear: we need to get Opal into the hands of more creators globally.” Opal works by getting users to enter a description of the app they want to make, after which the tool uses different Google models to do so. Once the app is ready, users can open the editor panel to view and customize the visual workflow of inputs, outputs, and generation steps. They can click any step to review or edit the prompt, or add new steps manually using Opal’s toolbar. Users can also publish their app to the web and share a link so others can test it with their own Google accounts. In addition to the expansion, Google also announced improvements coming to Opal. The tech giant says it has improved the debugging program but intentionally kept it no-code. Users can now run their workflow step by step in the visual editor or tweak specific steps in the console. Errors show up right where they happen to provide immediate context and eliminate guesswork. Google also says that it’s made significant improvements to Opal’s core performance. The company notes that previously it would take up to five seconds or more to create a new Opal. Now, it’s worked to speed that up to make it easier to get started. Plus, users can now run steps in parallel, allowing complex workflows with multiple steps to execute simultaneously. With the U.S. launch of Opal in July, Google join",

      "content": "Otter.ai CEO Sam Liang isn’t satisfied with the company being viewed, and used, as just a meeting notetaker. Liang wants Otter.ai to become a go-to source for enterprises and a new batch of products released Tuesday is the first step in that evolution. The Silicon Valley-based AI meeting assistant startup on Tuesday released a new suite of tools for enterprises designed to better incorporate data from meetings into other workflows by funneling that information to a central knowledge base. The aim is to grow Otter’s business by helping companies get more out of the meetings they record. Otter’s new product suite includes an API that allows users to build custom integrations with platforms like Jira and HubSpot, an MCP server — which connects users’ Otter data to external AI models — and a new AI agent that can search a company’s meetings notes or presentations. Liang told TechCrunch it is the next phase of Otter’s life. “We are evolving from a meeting notetaker to a corporate meeting knowledge base,” Liang said. “This is a system record for conversations. It can help corporations scale their growth and drive measurable business value.” When Otter was founded in 2016, there were just a handful of meeting transcription companies — a far leap from today. The AI boom that kicked off in 2022 fueled a surge in startups like Granola or Circleback. Even older players like Fireflies have seen a surge in interest. Liang argues this transition puts Otter into a separate division than its former peers. Meetings are where the majority of company knowledge is stored, in Liang’s opinion, whether that is notes from a customer sales call or discussions around a marketing strategy. But without a centralized place for these meeting notes, that information can only help a company so much. “A lot of times, inefficiency happens because of information silos,” Liang said. “One team doesn’t know what the other team is doing, and it thinks that that was planned like a month ago.

The move signals the AI startup’s push to deepen its presence in its second-largest market after the U.S. Amodei is expected to visit Mumbai to meet Ambani and other senior executives at Reliance Industries, India’s most valuable company and the parent of the nation’s top telecom operator, Reliance Jio, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Anthropic has been in discussions with Reliance for some time over a potential partnership to expand access to its Claude AI assistant in India, the people said. India — the world’s second-largest online market after China, with more than a billion internet subscribers — has emerged as an important growth region for Anthropic. Several Indian AI startups already use its Claude models in their products for both domestic and U.S. clients. India also accounts for the second-highest share of traffic to Claude’s website after the U.S., according to digital intelligence firm Similarweb. In August, Reliance Industries partnered with major technology companies, including its existing investors Google and Meta, to build AI infrastructure and enterprise solutions through its new unit, Reliance Intelligence. The Mumbai-headquartered conglomerate had also explored a potential collaboration with OpenAI, which rolled out its under-$5 ChatGPT plan in India earlier this year and announced plans to open an office in New Delhi later in 2025. That Reliance-OpenAI partnership was expected to be announced during OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s planned visit to India last month, but Altman ultimately postponed the trip. Reliance Industries did not respond to a request for comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to OpenAI for comment.

The demo was impressive, showing how programs like Spotify and Figma can be called or discovered without leaving the ChatGPT window. With so much of the tech world barreling toward AI integration, OpenAI’s demo was the best picture yet of what an AI-first internet might actually look like, with interfaces like ChatGPT querying information and executing commands directly. If you’re watching closely, you may have noticed that there’s a lot of room in this system for money to change hands. Just last week, the company launched Instant Checkout, an agentic shopping system that serves as payment infrastructure for one-off purchases, plugging in any stores that sell through Shopify, Etsy, or Stripe. Now, apps provide the front-end infrastructure, letting service providers build their own interface into ChatGPT. In short, OpenAI now has all the pieces in place for AI-driven commerce, establishing ChatGPT as a place customers go to buy and retailers go to sell. It’s a huge new line of business for the company — and one with huge implications for the tech industry. In this world, OpenAI isn’t just competing with Google and Anthropic, but with Amazon and Wal-Mart. If you look at OpenAI’s pending app partners in the launch announcement, you can see how far the vision reaches. ChatGPT will be able to call you a cab through Uber, book a trip on Expedia, call a plumber or locksmith through Thumbtack, and order groceries from Instacart, prepared food from DoorDash, or big-box goods from Target. Without too much more work, ChatGPT could become a portal for most of its users’ discretionary spending. If it works, this would be worth a lot more than just a $20-a-month subscription. The precise terms of the arrangement are still unclear, but like any app store, OpenAI is well-positioned to get a portion of any money spent on its platform.

      "content": "Professional services and consultant firm Deloitte announced a landmark AI enterprise deal with Anthropic the same day it was revealed the company would issue a refund for a government-contracted report that contained inaccurate AI-produced slop. The upshot: Deloitte’s deal with Anthropic is a referendum on its commitment to AI, even as it grapples with the technology. And Deloitte is not alone in this challenge. The timing of this announcement is interesting — comical even. On the same day Deloitte touted its increased use of AI, the Australia Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said the consulting company would have to issue a refund for a report it did for the department that included AI hallucinations, the Financial Times reported. The department had commissioned a A$439,000 “independent assurance review” from Deloitte, which was published earlier this year. The Australian Financial Review reported in August the review had a number of errors, including multiple citations to non-existent academic reports. A corrected version of the review was uploaded to the department’s website last week. Deloitte will repay the final installment of its government contract, the FT reported. TechCrunch reached out to Deloitte for comment and will update the article if the company responds. Deloitte announced plans to roll out Anthropic’s chatbot Claude to its nearly 500,000 global employees on Monday. Deloitte and Anthropic, which formed a partnership last year, plan to create compliance products and features for regulated industries including financial services, healthcare, and public services, according to an Anthropic blog post. Deloitte also plans to create different AI agent “personas” to represent the different departments within the company, including accountants and software developers, according to reporting from CNBC. “Deloitte is making this significant investment in Anthropic’s AI platform because our approach to responsible AI is very aligned, and togeth",

      "content": "For the release of her twelfth album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” Taylor Swift sent fans on an online scavenger hunt this weekend, which began by searching for “Taylor Swift” on Google. But as fans unveiled secret videos as part of the campaign, some fretted that the clips looked like they were AI-generated — and they were not pleased. A Google search for the singer’s name yields a cryptic message: “12 cities, 12 doors, 1 video to unlock.” Fans had to figure out the location of the doors, then physically find them and scan a QR code, which surfaced 12 unique videos that contained the clues needed to solve the puzzle. When fans Googled the correct phrase, another orange door appeared, which fans had to collectively “knock” on by clicking 12 million times. Finally, the door “opened,” revealing a lyric video for “The Fate of Ophelia,” which has its own orange door progress bar on YouTube. YouTube had scored the video exclusive for the track, as well as the lyric videos from the remaining songs on the new album. Google initially announced the scavenger hunt in a video on Instagram. The video begins with an aerial view of Earth, then quickly zooms in on a hilly, bejeweled landscape, until we see an orange door, overlayed with a Google search bar. A post shared by Google (@google) While Swifties love a puzzle, some were rubbed the wrong way by the 12 clue-containing videos, which looked to be AI-generated. Instead of searching for clues to unveil Swift’s new lyric video, as Swift intended, some fans began to scour the video clips like detectives, looking for signs that the scenes were synthetic. However, while there are clips that look computer-generated, it’s unclear if they were made using AI, and if so, to what extent. It would make sense if these videos were generated using Google’s AI products. As OpenAI shows off its new Sora 2 video generator, this Taylor Swift collaboration would be a serendipitous opportunity for Google to show millions of Swifties what its Veo 3 m",

      "content": "OpenAI unveiled new API updates at its Dev Day on Monday, introducing GPT-5 Pro, its latest language model, its new video generation model Sora 2, and a smaller, cheaper voice model. The updates were part of a series of announcements geared toward wooing developers to OpenAI’s ecosystem, including the launch of an agent-building tool and the ability to build apps in ChatGPT. The addition of GPT-5 Pro might appeal to developers building applications in finance, legal, and healthcare — industries that need “high accuracy and depth of reasoning,” per OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Altman also noted that voice capabilities will be essential in the future as it quickly becomes one of the primary ways people use to interact with AI. To that end, OpenAI is launching “gpt-realtime mini,” a smaller, cheaper voice model in API that supports low-latency streaming interactions for audio and speech. The new model is 70% cheaper than OpenAI’s previous advanced voice model but promises the “same voice quality and expressiveness.” Finally, creators involved in OpenAI’s developer ecosystem can now tap into Sora 2 in preview in the API. OpenAI released Sora 2, its latest audio and video generator, last week alongside the Sora app, a TikTok competitor filled with short AI-generated videos. The Sora app allows users to generate videos of themselves, friends, or anything based on a prompt, and share it via a TikTok-style algorithmic feed. “[Developers] now have access to the same model that powers Sora 2’s stunning video outputs right in your own app,” Altman said. Sora 2 builds on its previous generation with more realistic, physically consistent scenes with synchronized sound and greater creative control — from detailed camera direction to stylized visuals. “For example, you can take the iPhone view and prompt Sora to expand it into a sweeping, cinematic wide shot,” Altman said. “But one of the most exciting things that we’ve been working on is how well this new model pairs sound with visuals",

      "content": "The US Department of Energy appears poised to terminate funding for a pair of large carbon-sucking factories that were originally set to receive more than $1 billion in government grants, according to a department-issued list of projects obtained by MIT Technology Review and circulating among federal agencies. One of the projects is the South Texas Direct Air Capture Hub, a facility that Occidental Petroleum’s 1PointFive subsidiary planned to develop in Kleberg County, Texas. The other is Project Cypress in Louisiana, a collaboration between Battelle, Climeworks, and Heirloom. The list notes that around $50 million has been terminated for both projects, the initial tranche of federal funding for the developments. Each could have received about $500 million as the projects proceeded, according to the DOE announcement in 2023. It’s not immediately clear if the termination of the initial grants means the full funding will also be canceled. “It could mean nothing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “It could mean there's a renegotiation of the awards. Or it could mean they’re entirely cut. But the uncertainty certainly doesn’t help projects.” Battelle and 1PointFive didn’t immediately respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review. Nor did the Department of Energy. \"Market rumors have surfaced, and Climeworks is prepared for all scenarios,” Christoph Gebald, one of the company's co-CEOs, said in a statement. He added later: “The need for DAC is growing as the world falls short of its climate goals and we’re working to achieve the gigaton capacity that will be needed.”“We aren’t aware of a decision from DOE and continue to productively engage with the administration in a project review,” Heirloom said in a statement. The rising dangers of climate change have driven the development of the direct-air capture industry in recent years. Climate models have found that the world may need to",

      "content": "Kids have always played with and talked to stuffed animals. But now their toys can talk back, thanks to a wave of companies that are fitting children’s playthings with chatbots and voice assistants. It’s a trend that has particularly taken off in China: A recent report by the Shenzhen Toy Industry Association and JD.com predicts that the sector will surpass ¥100 billion ($14 billion) by 2030, growing faster than almost any other branch of consumer AI. According to the Chinese corporation registration database Qichamao, there are over 1,500 AI toy companies operating in China as of October 2025. One of the latest entrants to the market is a toy called BubblePal, a device the size of a Ping-Pong ball that clips onto a child’s favorite stuffed animal and makes it “talk.” The gadget comes with a smartphone app that lets parents switch between 39 characters, from Disney’s Elsa to the Chinese cartoon classic Nezha. It costs $149, and 200,000 units have been sold since it launched last summer. It’s made by the Chinese company Haivivi and runs on DeepSeek’s large language models. Other companies are approaching the market differently. FoloToy, another Chinese startup, allows parents to customize a bear, bunny, or cactus toy by training it to speak with their own voice and speech pattern. FoloToy reported selling more than 20,000 of its AI-equipped plush toys in the first quarter of 2025, nearly equaling its total sales for 2024, and it projects sales of 300,000 units this year. But Chinese AI toy companies have their sights set beyond the nation’s borders. BubblePal was launched in the US in December 2024 and is now also available in Canada and the UK. And FoloToy is now sold in more than 10 countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Brazil, Germany, and Thailand.

The app allows you to create a “cameo” of yourself—a hyperrealistic avatar that mimics your appearance and voice—and insert other peoples’ cameos into your own videos (depending on what permissions they set). To some people who believed earnestly in OpenAI’s promise to build AI that benefits all of humanity, the app is a punchline. A former OpenAI researcher who left to build an AI-for-science startup referred to Sora as an “infinite AI tiktok slop machine.” That hasn’t stopped it from soaring to the top spot on Apple’s US App Store. After I downloaded the app, I quickly learned what types of videos are, at least currently, performing well: bodycam-style footage of police pulling over pets or various trademarked characters, including SpongeBob and Scooby Doo; deepfake memes of Martin Luther King Jr. talking about Xbox; and endless variations of Jesus Christ navigating our modern world. Just as quickly, I had a bunch of questions about what’s coming next for Sora. Here’s what I’ve learned so far. OpenAI is betting that a sizable number of people will want to spend time on an app in which you can suspend your concerns about whether what you’re looking at is fake and indulge in a stream of raw AI. One reviewer put it this way: “It’s comforting because you know that everything you’re scrolling through isn’t real, where other platforms you sometimes have to guess if it’s real or fake. Here, there is no guessing, it’s all AI, all the time.\" This may sound like hell to some. But judging by Sora’s popularity, lots of people want it. So what’s drawing these people in? There are two explanations. One is that Sora is a flash-in-the-pan gimmick, with people lining up to gawk at what cutting-edge AI can create now (in my experience, this is interesting for about five minutes). The second, which OpenAI is betting on, is that we’re witnes",

Introducing: 10 climate tech companies to watch Every year, the MIT Technology Review newsroom produces a list of some of the most promising climate tech firms on the planet. It’s an exercise that we hope brings positive attention to companies working to decarbonize major sectors of the economy, whether by spinning up new, cleaner sources of energy or reinventing how we produce foods and distribute goods.Though the political and funding landscape has shifted dramatically in the US since last year, nothing has altered the urgency of the climate dangers the world now faces—we need to rapidly curb greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. This project highlights the firms making progress toward that end.Check out the third annual edition of the list, and learn more about why we selected these companies. Our best weapon against climate change is ingenuity —Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist.It’s a foregone conclusion that the world will not meet the goals for limiting emissions and global warming laid out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Many people want to blame politicians and corporations for this failure, but there’s an even more fundamental reason: We don’t have all the technological tools we need to do it, and many of the ones we do have are too expensive. But I don’t think this is a reason to be pessimistic. I see it as cause for optimism, because humans are very good at inventing things. In fact, we’ve already created many tools that are reducing emissions. And I am confident that more positive changes are coming. Read the full story.

Many people want to blame politicians and corporations for this failure, but there’s an even more fundamental reason: We don’t have all the technological tools we need to do it, and many of the ones we do have are too expensive. For all the progress the world has made on renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and electricity storage, we need a lot more innovation on every front—from discovery to deployment—before we can hope to reach our ultimate goal of net-zero emissions. But I don’t think this is a reason to be pessimistic. I see it as cause for optimism, because humans are very good at inventing things. In fact, we’ve already created many tools that are reducing emissions. In just the past 10 years, energy breakthroughs have lowered the global forecast for emissions in 2040 by 40%. In other words, because of the human capacity to innovate, we are on course to reduce emissions substantially by 2040 even if nothing else changes. And I am confident that more positive changes are coming. I’ve been learning about global warming and investing in ideas to stop it for the past 20 years. I’ve connected with unbiased scientists and innovators who are committed to preventing a climate disaster. Ten years ago, some of them joined me in creating Breakthrough Energy, an investment group whose sole purpose is to accelerate clean energy innovation. We’ve supported more than 150 companies so far, many of which have blossomed into major businesses such as Fervo Energy and Redwood Materials, two of this year’s Companies to Watch. [Editor’s note: Mr. Gates did not participate in the selection process of this year’s companies and was not aware that two Breakthrough investments had been selected when he agreed to write this essay.] Yet climate technologies offer more than just a public good.

      "title": "2025 Climate Tech Companies to Watch: HiNa Battery Technology and its effort to commercialize salt cells",
      "content": "HiNa Battery Technology is a trailblazer in developing and mass-producing batteries using sodium, a widely available element that can be extracted from sea salt. The startup’s products—already powering small vehicles and energy storage plants in China—provide a valuable alternative to lithium-based batteries, made with materials mined and processed in just a few countries. Over the next few decades the world will need a lot more batteries to power electric cars and keep grids stable. Today most battery cells are made with lithium, so the mineral is expected to be in hyper demand, leading to supply chain risks: 85% of the global lithium supply will be refined in just three countries in 2030—China, Chile, and Argentina, according to the International Energy Agency. But a new technology has come on the scene, potentially disrupting the global battery industry. Sodium-ion cells are made with an element 400 times more abundant than lithium. It can be found and extracted pretty much anywhere there is seawater or salt deposits in the ground, and harvesting it is a centuries-old practice. For decades, research of the technology was abandoned due to the huge commercial success of lithium-ion cells. Now, HiNa Battery Technology is working to bring sodium back to the limelight—and to the mass market. Led by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, HiNa’s goal is to commercialize sodium-ion technology in an industry dominated by lithium. To deliver that, it has built labs to develop its own chemistries and factories to make cells at scale. HiNa began mass manufacturing last year, bringing two sodium-ion products to market. One is a cube-shaped battery for storing electricity; it’s already powering commercial-scale energy storage stations in China, including one in Hubei Province that began operation in July 2024. The other product is a cylindrical battery already being used in electric mopeds (which are ubiquitous in China) and other small vehicles. Compared to their l",

      "title": "How we picked promising climate tech companies in an especially unsettling year",
      "content": "MIT Technology Review’s reporters and editors faced a dilemma as we began to mull nominees for this year’s list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch. How do you pick companies poised to succeed in a moment of such deep uncertainty, at a time when the new Trump administration is downplaying the dangers of climate change, unraveling supportive policies for clean technologies, and enacting tariffs that will boost costs and disrupt supply chains for numerous industries? We as a publication are focused more on identifying companies developing technologies that can address the escalating threats of climate change, than on businesses positioned purely for market success. We don’t fancy ourselves as stock pickers or financial analysts. But we still don’t want to lead our readers astray by highlighting a startup that winds up filing for bankruptcy six months later, even if its demise is due to a policy whiplash outside of its control. So we had to shift our thinking some.As a basic principle, we look for companies with the potential to substantially drive down greenhouse gas emissions or deliver products that could help communities meaningfully reduce the dangers of heatwaves, droughts, or other extreme weather. We prefer to feature businesses that have established a track record, by raising capital, building plants, or delivering products. We generally exclude companies where the core business involves extracting and combusting fossil fuels, even if they have a side business in renewables, as well as those tied to forced labor or other problematic practices. Our reporters and contributors add their initial ideas to a spreadsheet. We ask academics, investors, and other sources we trust for more nominees. We research and debate the various contenders, add or subtract from our list, then research and debate them all some more. Starting with our first climate tech list in 2023, we have strived to produce a final mix of companies that’s geographically diverse. But given the partic",
